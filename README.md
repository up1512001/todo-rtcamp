## Components

The React Todo App is modularized into components, making it easy for developers to understand and extend the functionality. Each major feature or section of the app is encapsulated in a separate component. Here's an overview of the components:

- **TodoApp:** The main component that holds the entire Todo App logic and layout.
- **FilterButtons:** A reusable component responsible for rendering filter radio buttons (All, Completed, Incomplete).
- **TodoList:** Displays the list of todos and manages individual todo items.
- **TodoItem:** Represents an individual todo item with features like editing, deleting, and toggling completion status.
- **SearchBar:** Provides a search input for filtering todos based on text.

## Media Queries

The app is designed to be responsive across different screen sizes. Media queries are used to adjust the layout and styling based on the device's screen width.
